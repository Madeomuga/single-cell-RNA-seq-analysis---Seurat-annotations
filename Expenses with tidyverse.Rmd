## Overview

The goal of tidyr is to help you create tidy data. Tidy data is data
where:

1. Every column is variable.
2. Every row is an observation.
3. Every cell is a single value.

Tidy data describes a standard way of storing data that is used wherever
possible throughout the tidyverse. If you ensure that your data is tidy,
you'll spend less time fighting with the tools and more time working on
your analysis. Learn more about tidy data in vignette("tidy-data").

## Installing and opening packages

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Navigating and setting working directory

```{r}
getwd()
setwd("/Users/madeo/OneDrive/Cloud/Learn programming/R/")
```

## Opening files

```{r}
df <- read.csv("df.csv")
```

## Dates in the dataframe

In this file there is a column that registers dates. The function
**class()** will check variable's nature.

```{r}
class(df$Date)
```

It is possible to manipulate the format of the dates using the function
**as.Date()** and giving the proper argument. From *R Cookbook - chapter
7.9*:

The format argument defines the appearance of the resulting string.
Normal characters, such as a slash (/) or hyphen (-), are simply copied
to the output string. Each two-letter combination of a percent sign (%)
followed by another character has special meaning. Some common ones are:

- %b
- Abbreviated month name ("Jan")
- %B
- Full month name ("January")
- %d
- Day as a two-digit number
- %m
- Month as a two-digit number
- %y
- Year without century (00--99)
- %Y
- Year with century

See the help page for the strftime function for a complete list of
formatting codes.

To create a column with a day and month with two digit numbers and year
with century:

```{r}
date_col <- as.Date(df$Date, "%d/%m/%Y")
#class(date_col)
```

## Columns

### Basic commands with columns

To **remove** an entire column from a data frame:

```{r}
df$Date<-NULL
```

To **append** a column stored in a variable:

```{r}
df$Date<-date_col
```

## Rows

### Basic commands with rows

To see the first top or bottom rows we can use the **head()** and **tail()** functions:

```{r}
head(dataframe_final)
tail(datafrane)
```

It is possible to merge two dataframes with the same structure (columnwise) using the rbind() function:

```{r}
dataframe_final <- rbind(dataframe1,dataframe2)
```

## Subsetting by conditions

The function subset() allows to select data from the data frame by a conditions:

```{r}

dataframe_final <- subset(dataframe1,dataframe1$column<condition)
```

## Creating new dataframes in which we store results using tidyverse

### Operations with mutate, summarise and group.by

The function [mutate.()][<https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html>] will create/add variables preserving the old one. However, **transmutate.()** will do the same but deleting the old variable.


In this example will create new columns containing the months and years
separately.

```{r}
df<-df %>%  mutate(month=format(Date,"%B"), year=format(Date,"%Y"))
```

Our objective now is to calculate **FOR EACH MONTH** the total amount earned and spent. To do so we will use the function summarise to do the calculations and store them in a new dataframe that will be grouped by months using the function group_by. [summarise()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) creates a new data frame. It will have one (or more) rows for each combination of grouping variables; if there are no grouping variables, the output will have a single row summarising all observations in the input. It will contain one column for each grouping variable and one column for each of the summary statistics that you have specified. Most data operations are done on groups defined by variables. [group_by()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html?q=groupby) takes an existing tbl and converts it into a grouped tbl where operations are performed "by group". **ungroup()** removes grouping.

```{r}
#2020
Total_in_out_2020 <- df %>%  group_by(month) %>% summarise(total_out=sum(Amount[InOut=="Out" & year=="2020"]),
                                                            total_in=sum(Amount[InOut=="In" & year=="2020"]))

#2021
Total_in_out_2021 <- df %>%  group_by(month) %>% summarise(total_out=sum(Amount[InOut=="Out" & year=="2021"]),
                                                           total_in=sum(Amount[InOut=="In" & year=="2021"]))
```

### Ordering dataframe based on a given vector

The months in this new data frame are not in order by month.To order
them we will use the function
[slice()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html) to index the
rows by their location and the match function to reorder them base on a
vector given:

```{r}
month_order<-c("enero","febrero","marzo","abril","mayo","junio","julio","agosto","sepriembre","octubre",
               "noviembre","diciembre")

Total_in_out_2020 <- Total_in_out_2020 %>% slice(match(month_order,month))

Total_in_out_2021 <- Total_in_out_2021 %>% slice(match(month_order,month))
```

Now we will create an additional column named as savings in which we
substract what we have spent to of what we have earn:

```{r}
Total_in_out_2020 <- Total_in_out_2020 %>%  mutate(savings=total_in-total_out)

```

# Loops

From ["An Introduction to R""](https://intro2r.com/). Loops are one of the staples of all programming languages, not just R, and can be a powerful tool (although in our opinion, used far too frequently when writing R code).

## For loop: iterating rows 
The basic structure of a **for** loop:

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}
```

For a later exercise I need to create a column in which records the sums your savings based on the in/out actions; meaning that each day will be updated with the amount that you have after getting/expeding money.

We want to go through all our dataframe so we need to tell our loop when to stop. Here it will be define by the total amount of rows:
```{r}
x<-nrow(df)
x
```
Next, we will simply generate a new column in which each row will have the value 0.

```{r}
df$Test[1]<-0
```

First, we will start the loop by assingingthe first value to the first row by "subtracting" to 0 our value since we know it is an expense (notice that our first condition doesn't know if it is an expense or income). From there, each new row ([i]) will result in the addition or subtraction of the previous row's value ([i-1]) depending on the type of the [i]row's value: expense or income respectively.

```{r}
for(i in 1:x){
  if(i==1){
    df$Test[i]=0-df$Amount[1]
  }
  else if(df$InOut[i]=="Out"){
    df$Test[i]=-df$Amount[i]+df$Test[i-1]
  }
  else if(df$InOut[i]=="In"){
    df$Test[i]=df$Amount[i]+df$Test[i-1]
  }
}
```

----> this needs to be explained in the plot section

```{r}
min <- as.Date("2020-01-01")
max <- NA
p1<-ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Date, y = Test))+
  geom_line(color = "#00AFBB", size = 2) + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", 
               labels=date_format("%b-%Y"),
               limits = as.Date(c('2020-01-01','2021-09-30')))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

## While loop: moving average for savings

```{r}
y<-matrix(1:20,nrow=20,ncol = 1)
colnames(y)<-"Number"
y<-as.data.frame(y)
length(y$Number)
y
i=3
window_size=6

n=length(y$Number)-3
y$SME<-0

y$SME[1]

while (i < n){
  current_window=y[(i-3):(i+3),1] #structure [from row:to row, from column]
  current_average=sum(current_window)/window_size
  y$SME[i]<-current_average
  i=i+1
  
}
y

y[(i-3):(i+3),1]
current_average
y[(i-3),(i+3)]
```

# Functions: moving average

```{r}
simple_moving_average <- function(dat_frame,column_name,wind_size){
  dat_frame$SME<-0
  
  while (wind_size < (20-wind_size)) {
    current_window=dat_frame[(wind_size-3):(wind_size+3),1] #structure [from row:to row, from column]
    current_average=sum(current_window)/(wind_size*2)
    dat_frame$SME[wind_size]<-current_average
    wind_size=wind_size+1
    
  }
  return(dat_frame)
  
}

simple_moving_average(y,"Number",3)
y


length(y$Number)-3

test<- function(dat_frame,column_name,wind_size){
  n<-(length(dat_frame[,column_name])-wind_size)
  dat_frame$SME<-0
  wind_average=wind_size*2
  wind_helper=wind_size
  while (wind_size < n) {
  current_window=dat_frame[(wind_size-wind_helper):(wind_size+wind_helper),column_name]
  current_average=sum(current_window)/(wind_average)
  dat_frame$SME[wind_size]<-current_average
  wind_size=wind_size+1
  current_average<-0
  }
  return(dat_frame)
}


test(y,"Number",3)

z<-test(df,"Test",10)

p2<-ggplot(data = z, aes(x = Date, y = SME))+
  geom_line(color = "#00AFBB", size = 2) + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", 
               labels=date_format("%b-%Y"),
               limits = as.Date(c('2020-06-30','2021-11-01')))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
p1
p2
